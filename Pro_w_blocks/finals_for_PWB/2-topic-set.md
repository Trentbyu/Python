SET
1.	Introduction: In Python, a Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements. Sets can be created by using the built-in set() function 
2.	Internal working of Set: If Multiple values are present at the same index position, then the value is appended to that index position, to form a Linked List. In, CPython Sets are implemented using dictionary with dummy variables, where key beings the members set with greater optimizations to the time complexity.
3.	Adding elements, add(): Elements can be added to the Set by using the built-in add() function. Only one element at a time can be added to the set by using add() method, loops are used to add multiple elements at a time with the use of add() method.
4.	Copy(): set_name.copy(), The copy() method returns a shallow copy of the set in python. The copy() method for sets doesnâ€™t take any parameters
5.	Operators for Sets: Intersection , Union, and Difference
6.	Union: Two sets can be merged using union() function or | operator. Both Hash Table values are accessed and traversed with merge operation perform on them to combine the elements, at the same time duplicates are removed.
7.	Intersection: This can be done through intersection() or & operator. Common Elements are selected. They are similar to iteration over the Hash lists and combining the same values on both the Table.
8.	Difference: To find difference in between sets. Similar to find difference in linked list. This is done through difference()
9.	Clearing sets clear():  set_name.clear(), The clear() method doesn't take any parameters. The clear() method doesn't return any value. clear() method to remove all the elements of the set so it will then be blank.
10.	Time complexity of Sets:  O(1) on average. However in worst case it can become O(n).
11.	Pros and cons: The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.
12. The top 3 erros of a set: syntax errors. logic errors. runtime errors.

# YOUR TURN

The task i have for you is the make a set using python and add numbers to a set using a for loop 
Then take all the items out of the set. Then demonstrate the intersection and union function with python 

## soultion in python file.
