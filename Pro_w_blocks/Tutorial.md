STACK
1.	Introduction: A stack is a data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. This means that an item you put inside of this stack will end up on top and when grabbing data from the list the ithem on top is grabed first hence last in first out. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only weather that be the top or the bottom.The stack is nothing but the linear data structure where insertion and deletion take place only at one end.


2.	Last in first out: This is what was descirbed in the intro the item last put into the stack is the first item out of the stack


3.	Types of stack: There are two types of stacks they are register stack and the memory stack. In the memory stack, the stack depth is flexible. It occupies a large amount of memory data, whereas in the register stack only a finite number of memory words will be stored.The register stack is also a memory device present in the memory unit, but it handles only a small amount of data. The stack depth is always limited in the register stack because the size of the register stack s very small compared to the memory.


4.	Applications of stack: A Stack can be used for evaluating expressions consisting of operands and operators. Stacks can be used for Backtracking, i.e., to check parenthesis matching in an expression.It can also be used to convert one form of expression to another form.It can be used for systematic Memory Management.
5.	Push():  stack.append('a') ,stack.append('b') , stack.append('c') this is a fucntion to add items to the stack. You have to specifiy what you want to add inside the () like done earlier. 
6.	Pop(): stack.pop() this is a function to delete an item from the stack. This will delte the last item put into the stack first in last out.
7.	Top(): Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack stack.top(). The top element will be the last item put in 
8.	isEmpty(): reutrns if the the stack is empty or has any amount of items in it. stack.isEmpty()
9.	size(): This function returns the size of the stack stack.size()
10.	advantages and disadvantages: Advantages of Stack, A Stack helps to manage the data in the ‘Last in First out’ method. When the variable is
not used outside the function in any program, the Stack can be used. It allows you to control and handle memory allocation and deallocation.
It helps to automatically clean up the objects. Disadvantages of Stack It is difficult in Stack to create many objects as it increases the risk of the Stack overflow. It has very limited memory. In Stack, random access is not possible.
